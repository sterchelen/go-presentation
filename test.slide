* Why Go ?

- We must go fast ! 
- Programming must be fun *AGAIN* !

A response to Google's needs:

- efficient large scale programming
- speed of compilation
- mutlicore ...

And a reaction to speed/safety or ease of use

- complexity, weight, noise (C++, .NET, Java)
- no static checking (Javascript, Python)

* What is Go ?

Go is a modern, general purpose language. Syntactically similar to C but with memory safety, akka GC. 

The efficiency of a statically-typed compiled language with the ease of programming of a dynamic language.

- Compiles to native machine code (32-bit; 64-bit ; ARM) / (Unix-like ; Windaube).
- Statically typed.
- Lightweight syntax (25 keywords vs 104 for C#).
- Simple type system.
- High-performance networking and multiprocessing thanks to concurrency primitives.
- High-speed compilation.

* Genesis

Robert Griesemer, Ken Thompson, and Rob Pike started the project in late 2007 as a 20% Google project, primarily motivated by their shared dislike of C++. 

- Announced in November 2009. 
- Version 1.0 was release in March 2012. It guarantees compatibility for the language spec and major parts of the standard library. All versions up to the current Go 1.12 have maintained this promise.
- Version 2.0 draft and discussion started in 13 July 2017.

"Consensus drove the design. Nothing went into the language until [Ken Thompson, Robert Griesemer, and myself] all agreed that it was right. Some features didnâ€™t get resolved until after a year or more of discussion."
